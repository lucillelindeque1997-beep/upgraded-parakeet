In-Depth Project Styling Analysis
Your project uses a sophisticated, modern styling approach combining multiple technologies and design systems. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

1. Design System Architecture
Shadcn/UI + Tailwind CSS Foundation:

Built on shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS as the utility framework
Uses CSS Custom Properties (CSS variables) for theming via HSL color values
Component-based architecture with reusable UI primitives
2. Color Palette & Theme System
Primary Color Scheme:

Purple/Blue Primary: hsl(221, 83%, 53%) - A vibrant blue-purple
Orange Accent: Used for highlights and CTAs (visible in gradients)
Grayscale Foundation: Gray-50 to Gray-900 for text and backgrounds
Dual Theme Support:

Light Theme: Clean whites with subtle gray backgrounds
Dark Theme: Deep grays (222.2, 84%, 4.9%) with bright accents
System Theme: Automatically detects user's OS preference
3. Typography System
Font Stack:

Primary: Poppins - Modern, friendly geometric sans-serif from Google Fonts
Secondary: Inter - Configured in Tailwind for clean readability
Monospace: JetBrains Mono - For code elements
Weights: 300-800 range for Poppins, providing excellent hierarchy
4. Visual Design Patterns
Gradient Usage:

Hero Section: Subtle radial gradient rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.05) for depth
CTAs & Buttons: Purple-to-orange gradients (from-purple-600 to-orange-500)
Interactive Elements: Hover state gradients for engagement
Layout Patterns:

Responsive Grid System: CSS Grid with breakpoints (md:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-4)
Container-based: Max-width constraints (max-w-7xl) with auto-centering
Consistent Spacing: Tailwind's spacing scale (py-16, px-4, gap-8)
5. Component Styling Philosophy
Card-Based Design:

Clean white/dark backgrounds with subtle shadows
Rounded corners using CSS custom properties (var(--radius))
Consistent padding and spacing patterns
Interactive States:

Hover Effects: Color transitions, background changes
Focus States: Ring utilities for accessibility
Smooth Animations: 200ms duration transitions throughout
6. Custom Animations
Built-in Animations:

Accordion: Smooth expand/collapse with height transitions
Fade-in: Opacity-based entrance animations
Slide-in: Transform-based Y-axis animations
Duration: Consistent 0.2-0.3s timing for smooth UX
7. Responsive Design Strategy
Mobile-First Approach:

Base styles for mobile, enhanced for larger screens
Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1400px)
Flexible Typography: Scales from text-4xl to text-6xl based on screen size
8. Accessibility Features
Color Contrast:

HSL-based color system ensures proper contrast ratios
Separate foreground colors for each background tone
Focus Management:

Ring utilities for keyboard navigation
Proper color contrast in all themes
9. Component Library Structure
UI Primitives: 40+ components in /ui/ folder

Form elements (Button, Input, Select, etc.)
Layout components (Card, Sheet, Dialog, etc.)
Data display (Table, Badge, Avatar, etc.)
Feedback (Toast, Alert, Progress, etc.)
10. Performance Considerations
CSS Optimization:

Tailwind Purging: Only includes used classes in production
CSS Variables: Efficient theme switching without re-rendering
Minimal Custom CSS: Leverages utility classes for consistency
Overall Aesthetic:
Your project embodies a modern agency aesthetic with:

Clean, minimalist design with purposeful whitespace
Professional purple/blue and orange color combination
Smooth animations and micro-interactions
Consistent component patterns
Excellent dark/light mode implementation
Mobile-responsive design throughout
